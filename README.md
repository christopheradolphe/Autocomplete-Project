# Autocomplete-Project
In this project, I will write a fast implementation of the autocomplete functionality. I will be working with files that contain a large number of terms, along with the importance weight associated with the respective terms. I will retrieve the top terms that match a query string. For example, if the query string is "Eng", the matches might be "English", or "Engineering".
